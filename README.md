# CodeIT
Coding Website

<CodeIT/> is an interactive website that was created to help teach basic level programming. The inspiration came from sites like "Codecademy" and "Code Battles". I wanted to create a project that was going to push me outside my comfort zones, and force me to learn concepts I thought were challenging. I'm also a huge advocate for getting kids into programming, so I figured this could serve as a platform for that purpose. The website allows users to sign up for an account, manage and customize their own pages, add friends, and challenge them to coding challenges, all while competing lessons on a variety of languages. The code shown here is not currently linked to a database, it is just a backup. 

The reposistory is set up so that each folder is a different page that contains it's own html, javascript, and php file. There is also global css, javascript, and php which can be found in their own folders.
